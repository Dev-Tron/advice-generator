## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

From this project, I learned that the most important thing to absolute positioning is that it is positioned relative to its parent container when its parent is set at position relative. I learned how to style and center a div more efficiently as well.

### Continued development

Need to learn more logic. I feel stupid and still have to rely on others solutions.
